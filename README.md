# Kaggle-Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction

*A collection of work related to the [Santander Customer Transaction Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).*

*Language:* Python

The competition is still on-going. As soon as I have something to share, a script or a Jupyter notebook file, it will be added to this repository. Currently, the repository contains the following files:

1. README.md -- this file.
2. Santander_EDA_Simple_Modeling.ipynb -- a Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis of the data and some baseline modeling. The list of models: 
  * Logistic Regession 
  * Elastic Net 
  * Gaussian Naive Bayes
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  * Quandratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).
3. logistic-regression-with-new-features-feather.ipynb -- a Jupyter notebook introducing some additional numerical feature variables with Logistic Regression model. The notebook also illustrates the usage of the `feather` file format for saving and loading data. The notebook is [publically available](https://www.kaggle.com/graf10a/logistic-regression-with-new-features-feather) on the Kaggle website.
